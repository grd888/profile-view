# User Profile Screen with Scrollable Detail Area

This simple user profile screen skeleton project can be used as a starting point for creating more sophisticated views.

It has placeholders for profile photo and cover photo, name and position.

The bottom area is a container view with embedded view controller that can be scrolled up to full view. Constraint-based animation was used for the scrolling function.
